				Tough one to start with. I mean, does anybody really know their purpose in life, or do they just learn
				to deal with the fact that simply living is enough to stay around? I'm not really sure.
			</p>
			<p>
				For me, I feel as though I often find purpose in how I make other people feel. I like making people feel
				happy or I try to get a laugh out of them, or I try to be useful whenever possible (often at the cost of
				my own patience...), but as it currently stands I don't exactly know what to do with myself. At the
				moment, I am taking a professional programming course that began in December of last year, which at the
				time seemed like the most logical thing for me to do and take on, to try and make a living off of it
				later as an actual job. Most of my time spent is in front of a screen, so why not take advantage of
				that? I also became familiar with computers and tech in general at a pretty young age and started
				delving into hobbyist programming, for fun. It makes sense for me to pursue such a career, then, right?
				It seems logical. And, well, it is. To me, anyway! (and my mom who very much insisted I take the course)
			</p>
			<p>
				Things were going as one would expect. Boring classes for the first couple months, nothing to do with
				programming at all, felt like I was in highschool again... Except everyone around me was much older. No
				big deal, they were still easy enough classes that it didn't bother me. And it was only one class for
				4 hours every day! Around March, though, we started actually programming. Pure HTML to begin with,
				followed quickly after by CSS, and eventually JavaScript, PHP and SQL. In a way, it was actually kind of
				fun making shitty-looking webpages using nothing but HTML and CSS in the beginning. Reminiscent of
				the old web where things weren't overly complicated and messy. Not like I was around for that, anyway.
				I'm not *that* old. I would take at most an hour or two per assignment, which makes sense as I
				previously stated I've done programming before, so I would spend the rest of my time doing whatever on
				the computer or being on my phone.
			</p>
			<p>
				Eventually, and it didn't take long for me to notice, things became very repetitive. One assignment
				after the other, they all seemed like clones of each other except with key words altered. Instead of
				making a website for, I don't know, some book rental service, you would make one for a grocery store
				instead. Take the previous assignment, change some words around, maybe add or remove some functionality
				on the JavaScript side, and done. Easy! What's there to complain about? Rinse and repeat, learn a new
				JavaScript function or a bloated library every couple of days and get familiar with it in new
				assignments until the next thing to learn comes. Four hours a day, easy, repetitive assignments, this is
				going to be a breeze, I thought. As time has passed, however, I have realized that this doesn't seem
				like the right thing for me. Sitting in front of a screen for hours, doing repetitive work that I don't
				enjoy in any capacity, does not sound like a fun job I'd be willing to take. But as I write this I am
				still taking the course, because I don't know what else to do. It sounds ironic, because I just sit and
				stare at this screen for 90% of my day, almost every day, so why would I be bothered by doing it for a
				living? Because it's not enjoyable, like, at all. I'm good at it, or so I would like to think, but it
				doesn't really... make me feel anything. Even when I finish assignments or projects. It's just mostly
				nothing with a pinch of extreme boredom. Not to say that taking on a real programming job would be as
				repetitive as what I'm currently doing is, but the act of programming itself is not enjoyable to me.
				Monotonous. Cool word.
			</p>
			<p>
				So that's where I am today. Taking a course I don't like, still very much lost in life, not knowing what
				to do with myself. Ending highschool and starting this course really took this feeling of lostness I
				already had and increased it tenfold. I don't know what purpose I have in life for myself, excluding
				others, and to me that's scary. I am still relatively young, but societal and (mainly) familial pressure
				affect me a lot in these kinds of things, making me think I am very much behind everyone else around my
				age and that there must be something wrong with me for me to be the way I am. Everyone else is doing
				just fine! It sucks. There is a lot to think about, a lot to explore, and I am terrible at writing, but
				maybe in a future blogpost I will talk more about it, make it a part 2 or something.
			</p>
			<p>
				For now, though, I will leave whoever is reading this with this very poorly written first blogpost of
				mine. I hope you cringed many times while reading it.
