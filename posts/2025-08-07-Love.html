			<p>It's been a little while since my last blogpost, and I wish I could say things have been going well since
				I last sat down to write one of these, but that is far from the truth. I have experienced a roller
				coaster of emotions almost every day and things have been extremely stressful in general. It's not a
				good time.</p>
			<p>Despite that, I felt like I wanted to write about perhaps my hardest topic ever: Love. It's been weighing
				heavily in my mind for a loooong time, and I think that writing about it will help me somewhat
				understand this messy soup of feelings I constantly deal with, and if not for that, I can at least get a
				lot of things off my chest. Whether that actually helps or not, I don't know, but I want to talk about
				it anyway. Despite the title of this blogpost, I am more than likely to go ahead and talk about many
				feelings beyond just love. This will include heavy mentions of topics such as depression and suicide, so
				if that's not your thing, respectfully shoo. It might be very "vent-y." Oh, and cringe too. You're at
				your own fault for reading beyond this point if any of those topics make you uncomfortable. I also hope
				you don't mind any verb tense inconsistencies, if any make it through the final version of this
				blogpost. I'm not a native speaker!!</p>
			<p>Let's start around mid 2023, so June or July. I had turned 17 years old earlier that year, and around
				this time I met someone online and we quickly became good friends in a matter of days. We would find
				something to talk about almost constantly, and it was always a good time for me. Paired with the fact
				that we had so many interests in common, I had this sort of thought looming in the back of my mind that
				this friendship would become something more, but I never was the first to "confess" my feelings to them.
				It sort of came naturally after our conversations gradually became more and more flirty, and I guess one
				day it just kind of hit me that this was it, that I was in a "proper" relationship for the first time in
				my life. Every day was exciting and I was happy to spend time talking to this person and things were
				just. Good. And they were good for quite some time. It was like my mind was high on oxytocin, dopamine,
				serotonin, you name it. All the feel-good hormones were kicking hard.</p>
			<p>As the months passed by, we would discuss some heavier topics and this is when I found out that this
				person had severe depression. I had already known for a while that I was not particularly good at
				comforting other people, but I reassured them that if nothing else, I was there to listen to any and all
				of their troubles and that I would try my best to understand them and stay by their side all the time.
				It became quickly clear that despite this, my efforts were not even close to being enough to help them,
				at least in any meaningful long-term way, especially in a long-distance relationship. It was hard for me
				as it was for them, seeing them go through what they had to go through, but I was persistent no matter
				what. In my mind, I truly loved this person, and no matter what I would stay persistent through every
				hardship. You can probably see where things are going.</p>
			<p>Things kept deteriorating, and not at a slow pace either. I would often get ignored or hurt by things
				they said, and despite that I kept convincing myself that it would get better whenever we got together
				in person. I essentially trapped myself in a hole I kept digging deeper and deeper every time I chose to
				stay around, which ate away at my own mental well-being, and before any of this happened I would have
				not considered myself "depressed" or in any prolonged unhealthy / bad mental state. I would get bored at
				times, sure, but as anyone else does. I would feel indifferent about speo cnding time alone as opposed
				to
				spending it with others, whether that was this person or any of my friends. It's how I was used to
				spending time online.</p>
			<p>A few more weeks passed by and it became very clear that this didn't seem sustainable for either of us,
				but at this point I was still in denial. I had such good memories with this person in my mind and I
				could not fathom it being over. They were basically a second "me," as narcissistic as that might sound,
				or a sort of "soulmate," because of everything we had in common. To me, losing them was like losing my
				whole world. Trust me, looking back, I know how stupid that sounds. Fast forward a little bit and now it
				is February 2024, and my big 18th birthday is coming up soon on Valentine's Day of all days. How lucky I
				am. Things were very poor between us at this point but nothing was set in stone (at least from my
				perspective) in regards to the future of our relationship, I was pretty much just getting ignored
				multiple days at a time and when I received a reply it would be largely meaningless. And my birthday
				passed. Don't get me wrong, I had a good time spending it with my family, and despite all the turmoil, I
				consider it to have been a good day, looking back at it now, but I was still very conscious the whole
				day that this entire relationship was an unsustainable mess and that something had to be done.</p>
			<p>A week or so later, I told everything to a couple of friends I consider close to me, and discussed it
				further specifically with one of them and eventually came up with a decently sized message for me to
				send to this person, and so I did. I also talked to their closest friend who I had known about during
				pretty much the entirety of our relationship, and they knew about me as well, and they were extremely
				nice and understanding of the whole situation and cleared / clarified some things up regarding the way
				this person acted in general. They essentially "locked" themselves up and were only talking to another
				close friend who I also vaguely knew but never contacted. At this point I knew that if I never got a
				response, things were officially over. Once again, I was fully in denial despite everything I went
				through up until this point. As the days kept going by, I grew increasingly worried, stressed out, and
				extremely depressed. I would spend entire afternoons in my bed crying, I would cry in the shower, I
				would cry every time I was home alone, I was barely able to stop myself from crying in school, anything
				you could think of that wasn't physical self-harm. It was truly terrible, something I hadn't even come
				close to experiencing ever before, every day was miserable and I couldn't think properly about anything.
				It got so bad to the point where I would have panic attacks right before going to sleep and needed to
				take pills to calm me down.</p>
			<p>Eventually, I opened up to my mother and by consequence my headteacher (as it was affecting me
				academically) who were both thankfully very supportive of the entire situation and I was forwarded to
				the school therapist. I had one session with them before I chickened out, which I am aware was a stupid
				decision, but ultimately I can't say for sure if those sessions would have helped me or not, given how
				the first one went.
				Days, weeks, and eventually months went by. Any hope that I had left had dissipated by this point. There
				was nothing left, no feelings for them. Nothing but regret in how I handled things in general, knowing
				that I could've fully avoided this. I would like to believe I had gotten better as I wasn't constantly
				thinking about them anymore, and when I did I wouldn't break down into nothing but crying and despair
				anymore. I think it was also good to realize I was essentially "love-bombed" into this relationship,
				since any feelings I had for this person I thought were permanent, really were not. Despite this, one
				thing was missing: "constant" company. I absolutely took it for granted, all that time when I would just
				message them about anything and get a reply and often an entire conversation out of it. I got so used to
				it without realizing that if this relationship ever came crashing down, I would lose that as well. I was
				a very impressionable person at the time, and I still think I am to an extent today, and my brain was
				essentially "rewired" into needing someone to talk to at all times. I still struggle with this at the
				time of writing. I had lost any proper ability to be able to be content in being by myself, doing my own
				things, without having to bother other people. It was bad then, it still is now. I miss it so much. On
				top of this, I have lingering issues from that relationship such as anxiety attachment / separation
				anxiety, which just sucks.</p>
			<p>So now we are around May 2024, and I can say for sure that I'm over it, besides the whole needing company
				part and whatever... unless you don't count that as "being over it," then I guess to this day I'm still
				not. Anyway, a good friend of mine that I had known for a few years already realized they were gay
				around this time and... whoops. Something in me was "rekindled," and oh my god I don't even know how to
				describe all that I was feeling at this time. It definitely didn't help the fact that I had a crush on
				him in the past despite him being straight at the time, so I never really got anywhere with that beyond
				"welp that's unlucky, nothing I can do" LOL. As time went on I tried becoming closer to him because I
				thought to myself that it was so fucking cool that I finally had a gay friend I could relate with and
				talk to, and we would spend a lot of time together daily, it was great. This went on for a while, and
				still holds somewhat true to this day. It makes me really happy looking back on all of it.</p>
			<p>Unfortunately, at times, I would have mixed feelings and I would talk to him about them, but nothing too
				specific because I was extremely terrified of turning our friendship awkward by confessing to him the
				feelings I had, or god forbid, even "ruining" the friendship. I didn't like that I wasn't being fully
				honest either, but the fear of fucking things up had taken over me and I took that route instead. Deep
				in me I knew that this would be nothing more than a crush, I guess, but "for real" this time, and I
				would get this sinking feeling in my chest every time I realized that I wouldn't have any actual chances
				because of things I had become aware of by that point, like the fact that he already was in love with
				someone else or that neither of us were at all ready for a proper relationship, let alone a
				long-distance one. That was out of the question due to my past experience, as well as his, and I
				understood.</p>
			<p>Things had been going great still, and around March of this year I decided to muster up the courage to
				tell him that I had feelings for him. It was extremely hard for me, but I decided that this was the best
				option out of all that I had considered and that whatever came of it, I'd somehow deal with it. By this
				point, I had told a couple of very close friends (who are also friends of his) about the entire ordeal
				and explained to them that I liked him, trying to seek some closure in case something terrible came of
				it, I don't know. I told him that I wanted to talk to him about something, and when the time came, I
				kind of froze up for a couple of minutes. It was as simple as saying "I have feelings for you," and yet
				I was so afraid to say those words in consequence of what could happen next. But I said it, and when I
				tell you that it was such an insanely relieving moment, it really was. He thought it was cool and we had
				a meaningful conversation over it, covering things such as what I mentioned earlier, the fact that
				neither of us are really properly capable of a relationship due to everything going on in our lives, and
				that if we were to be in an online relationship it would be a terrible idea given both of our past
				experiences, as well as some other things. If you ask me, I don't think it could've gone any better out
				of all the scenarios my mind kept looping through and I'm so glad that it went the way it did, I even
				asked for reassurance regarding the future of our friendship and I was made sure that it would not go
				sour or awkward or anything like that, and I believe this has held true and I'm forever grateful for it.
				I think it was good that we had this conversation because I didn't know how much longer I could handle
				being uncertain about everything. I'm a person who tries to seek meaning in everything I can, which is
				often to my own detriment as it leads me to overthinking everything.</p>
			<p>I don't want to go over too many more specifics than I already have, but man. I realize how incredibly
				lucky I am that I still hang out with him or talk to him almost every day, how lucky I am that I can
				still talk about very heavy topics with him, all this and more despite my confession. I don't know, I
				feel like that usually doesn't happen, but it's not like I have any past experience anyway, so I'm just
				talking out of my ass I guess. He is genuinely such an amazing person to have in my life and without
				sounding like I'm blinded by love I really think he's a great part of it, he always seems open to talk
				about anything.</p>
			<p>Of course, it's not all sunshine and rainbows though. Over time I have had a couple of rough days, and
				even weeks. I consider myself to be quite a volatile person and when your pair that with strong romantic
				feelings that are not reciprocated it messes me up. Do keep in mind that I'm not at all blaming him for
				it, quite the opposite. I've been meaning to change that but it's as hard as anything else, and for me
				it has been incredibly difficult to try and leave the unhealthy cycle I've been in since my first
				relationship I touched on earlier. We have both messed up things in the past in our friendship and we
				have acknowledged it and worked on it to make sure such things don't happen again, and I find that
				extremely valuable. We are still close friends, after all, and the last thing I want to do is fuck
				things up, although I will admit I definitely have done some incredibly stupid shit in the past to the
				point where I was unsure if we were going to stay as friends. It's hard for me, as it is hard for him,
				in his own ways of course. This is going to sound weird but I don't really know any other way to put it,
				but I still have a lot of mixed feelings for it all. I didn't realize how hard having actual romantic
				feelings for another person would hit me, and I'm very slowly trying to process through it all, but it
				is difficult and stressful. That much I am sure of, but all the other mixed feelings that get in the way
				just mess with my mood and well-being a lot, sometimes to the point of depression and rarely even
				suicide. Don't worry though, suicide for me is nothing more than just a consequence of
				having intrusive thoughts. Despite everything I love all of my friends and family, and I obviously can't
				forget my beloved silly orange cat Vasco either 💚, I would do anything for him.</p>
			<p>But I think with all of that, here we are today. It has been one hell of a rough time for sure, but more
				importantly I firmly believe that this is still the preferred outcome over anything else. He makes me
				happy more than anything, I always love talking to him about whatever it is and he really just makes my
				life better.</p>
			<p>Don't think I have much else to add on to. Sorry if the second half of this was very messy and / or
				repetitive. While writing I was subconsciously thinking that it was going to be that way and I don't
				really feel like going back to fix anything, as long as it's comprehensible I'm fine with that. The
				future is certainly uncertain, and I have no idea what it holds for me, but whatever it may be, I am
				truly glad to have him in my life as a friend, if nothing more, and in the end, both of these
				experiences have made me grow immensely as a person.</p>
			<p>No promises that I'll return with something easier to digest next time. Gulp.</p>
